## Software Setup
* If you have Windows, then Linux OS can be installed as any one of the below:
    * [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) (Easiest and safe)
    * [Virtual Box](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/) (might slow down your system performance)
    * [Dual Boot](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/) (Prefer only if you know how to do it or have guidance on how to do it)
* If you have Linux, you can continue with additional tools on Linux without the need for Windows
